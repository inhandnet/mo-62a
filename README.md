## 1. Overview

MO-62A is a single-board computer based on the TI AM62A7 processor, designed for edge AI inference, machine vision, and industrial control applications. The AM62A7 integrates a quad-core Arm Cortex-A53 (up to 1.4 GHz), a single Cortex-R5F real-time processor, and a dedicated MMA (Matrix Multiplication Accelerator), delivering up to 2 TOPS of AI inference performance.

This SDK is built on top of **TI Processor SDK Linux RT EdgeAI AM62A EVM 11.01.07.05** and provides full hardware customization support for the MO-62A board. It includes the following components:

- **U-Boot**: Bootloader customized for MO-62A, including R5 SPL and A53 U-Boot
- **Linux Kernel**: Kernel and device trees customized for MO-62A, based on TI Linux RT kernel
- **Build System**: Unified Makefile-based build and staging workflow
- **Flash Tool**: Supports direct SD card writing and offline balenaEtcher image creation

## 2. Environment Setup

### 2.1 Host System Requirements

The following host environment has been verified for building this SDK:

| Item | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (x86_64) |
| Kernel | 6.8.0 or later |
| Architecture | x86_64 |

Required host packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
  xinetd tftpd nfs-kernel-server minicom \
  build-essential libncurses5-dev autoconf automake \
  dos2unix screen lrzsz lzop flex libssl-dev \
  u-boot-tools make git parted dosfstools e2fsprogs \
  pv xz-utils zip wget curl
```

### 2.2 Clone This Repository

Clone the MO-62A SDK to any directory on your host machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inhandnet/mo-62a.git
cd mo-62a
```

### 2.3 Initialize the Environment with setup.sh

Run `setup.sh` from the SDK root to initialize the development host:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Verifies** the host OS (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
2. **Adds** the current user to the `dialout` group (required for serial port access)
3. **Installs** required host packages — press `Y` to install, `n` to skip if already installed
4. **Writes** `TI_SDK_PATH` to `~/.bashrc` pointing to the cloned repository root, so the variable persists across terminal sessions
5. **Creates** a symlink at `/opt/ti-processor-sdk-linux-rt-edgeai-am62a-evm-11.01.07.05` pointing to the cloned repository, required because the cross-compilation toolchain binaries have a hardcoded ELF interpreter path at that location

Example output:

```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MO-62A SDK setup script
SDK root: /home/user/mo-62a
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verifying Linux host distribution
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is being used, continuing..

User 'user' is already in the 'dialout' group.

Do you wish to install required host packages? (Y/n) n
Host package installation skipped.

TI_SDK_PATH is already set correctly in /home/user/.bashrc:
  export TI_SDK_PATH="/home/user/mo-62a"
TI_SDK_PATH is now set to: /home/user/mo-62a

Creating toolchain symlink...
  /opt/ti-processor-sdk-linux-rt-edgeai-am62a-evm-11.01.07.05 -> /home/user/mo-62a

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MO-62A SDK setup completed!
You can now build the SDK from: /home/user/mo-62a
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

> **Note:** After `setup.sh` completes, `TI_SDK_PATH` is active in the current shell and will be automatically set in all future terminal sessions via `~/.bashrc`. Running `setup.sh` again is safe — it will update the symlink and the `TI_SDK_PATH` entry without creating duplicates.

### 2.4 Toolchain

Two cross-compilation toolchains are included in the SDK:

**AArch64 toolchain** — used for Linux kernel and A53 U-Boot:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Path | `linux-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-oe-linux/` |
| Prefix | `aarch64-oe-linux-` |
| GCC version | 13.4.0 |
| Target sysroot | `linux-devkit/sysroots/aarch64-oe-linux/` |

**ARMv7 R5 toolchain** — used for R5 SPL (tiboot3):

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Path | `k3r5-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/bin/arm-oe-eabi/` |
| Prefix | `arm-oe-eabi-` |
| GCC version | 13.4.0 |
| Target sysroot | `k3r5-devkit/sysroots/armv7at2hf-vfp-oe-eabi/` |

To verify both toolchains are available (run after `setup.sh` has completed):

```bash
# AArch64
linux-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-oe-linux/aarch64-oe-linux-gcc --version

# ARMv7 R5
k3r5-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/bin/arm-oe-eabi/arm-oe-eabi-gcc --version
```

Expected output:

```
aarch64-oe-linux-gcc (GCC) 13.4.0
Copyright (C) 2023 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

arm-oe-eabi-gcc (GCC) 13.4.0
Copyright (C) 2023 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
```

> **Note:** The toolchain binaries have a hardcoded ELF interpreter path pointing to `/opt/ti-processor-sdk-linux-rt-edgeai-am62a-evm-11.01.07.05/`. The symlink created by `setup.sh` satisfies this requirement regardless of where the repository is cloned. The toolchains are invoked automatically via `Rules.make` and do not require manual PATH export.

## 3. U-Boot

### 3.1 Related Files

MO-62A specific files added to the U-Boot source tree:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `board-support/ti-u-boot-2025.01+git/configs/am62ax_mo_62a_a53_defconfig` | A53 U-Boot defconfig |
| `board-support/ti-u-boot-2025.01+git/configs/am62ax_mo_62a_r5_defconfig` | R5 SPL defconfig |
| `board-support/ti-u-boot-2025.01+git/dts/upstream/src/arm64/ti/k3-am62a7-mo-62a.dts` | A53 main device tree |
| `board-support/ti-u-boot-2025.01+git/dts/upstream/src/arm64/ti/k3-am62a7-mo-62a-pinmux.dtsi` | Pin mux configuration |
| `board-support/ti-u-boot-2025.01+git/arch/arm/dts/k3-am62a7-r5-mo-62a.dts` | R5 SPL device tree |
| `board-support/ti-u-boot-2025.01+git/arch/arm/dts/k3-am62a7-mo-62a-u-boot.dtsi` | U-Boot specific DT additions |

Prebuilt firmware required during the build (from TI, not modified):

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `board-support/prebuilt-images/am62a-evm/bl31.bin` | Arm Trusted Firmware (TF-A) |
| `board-support/prebuilt-images/am62a-evm/bl32.bin` | OP-TEE OS |
| `board-support/prebuilt-images/am62a-evm/ti-dm/am62axx/dm_edgeai_mcu1_0_release_strip.out` | TI Device Manager firmware |

### 3.2 Build U-Boot

U-Boot is built in two separate passes — R5 SPL first, then A53 U-Boot. Both are invoked via the top-level `make` from the SDK root.

**Build R5 SPL (tiboot3):**

```bash
make u-boot-r5
```

This configures the R5 build with `am62ax_mo_62a_r5_defconfig` and compiles using the ARMv7 R5 toolchain (`arm-oe-eabi-`). The output is placed in `board-support/u-boot-build/r5/`.

**Build A53 U-Boot:**

```bash
make u-boot-a53
```

This configures the A53 build with `am62ax_mo_62a_a53_defconfig` and compiles using the AArch64 toolchain (`aarch64-oe-linux-`), incorporating `bl31.bin`, `bl32.bin`, and the TI Device Manager firmware via binman. The output is placed in `board-support/u-boot-build/a53/`.

**Build both in one step:**

```bash
make u-boot
```

### 3.3 Stage Build Artifacts

After a successful build, copy the output binaries to `board-support/built-images/`:

```bash
make u-boot_stage
```

### 3.4 Build Output

After staging, the following files are available in `board-support/built-images/`:

| File | Size | Source | Description |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| `tiboot3-am62ax-gp-mo-62a.bin` | ~318 KB | R5 build | R5 SPL for GP (General Purpose) devices |
| `tiboot3-am62ax-hs-fs-mo-62a.bin` | ~320 KB | R5 build | R5 SPL for HS-FS (High Security, Field Securable) devices |
| `tiboot3-am62ax-hs-mo-62a.bin` | ~320 KB | R5 build | R5 SPL for HS (High Security) devices |
| `tiboot3.bin` | ~320 KB | R5 build | Default tiboot3 (HS-FS, used by flash tool) |
| `tispl.bin` | ~1.7 MB | A53 build | TI SPL — loads OP-TEE, TF-A, and A53 U-Boot |
| `u-boot.img` | ~1.2 MB | A53 build | A53 U-Boot FIT image |

> **Note:** The appropriate `tiboot3-*.bin` variant depends on the device security state. Most production MO-62A boards ship as HS-FS, which uses `tiboot3-am62ax-hs-fs-mo-62a.bin`. The flash tool uses `tiboot3.bin` (a copy of the HS-FS variant) by default.

## 4. Linux Kernel

### 4.1 Related Files

MO-62A specific files added to the Linux kernel source tree:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `board-support/ti-linux-kernel-6.12.35+git-ti-rt/arch/arm64/configs/am62ax_mo_62a_defconfig` | MO-62A base kernel defconfig |
| `board-support/ti-linux-kernel-6.12.35+git-ti-rt/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62a7-mo-62a.dts` | MO-62A main device tree |
| `board-support/ti-linux-kernel-6.12.35+git-ti-rt/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62a7-mo-62a-pinmux.dtsi` | Pin mux configuration |

The following kernel config fragments are applied on top of the defconfig during the build:

| Fragment | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `ti_arm64_prune.config` | `kernel/configs/` | Removes non-TI ARM64 platform support to reduce build size |
| `ti_rt.config` | `kernel/configs/` | Enables PREEMPT_RT real-time kernel patches |

### 4.2 Build DTBs

Build all device tree blobs (62 DTBs and DTBOs in total):

```bash
make linux-dtbs
```

This configures the kernel with `am62ax_mo_62a_defconfig` + `ti_arm64_prune.config` + `ti_rt.config`, then builds all DTBs matching the prefix patterns defined in `Rules.make`:

```
ti/k3-am62a7  ti/k3-fpdlink  ti/k3-am62x-sk  ti/k3-v3link
```

Output is placed in `board-support/ti-linux-kernel-6.12.35+git-ti-rt/arch/arm64/boot/dts/`.

### 4.3 Build Kernel

Build the kernel image, modules, and FitImage:

```bash
make linux
```

This performs the following steps in order:

1. Builds DTBs (calls `linux-dtbs` automatically)
2. Builds U-Boot (calls `u-boot` automatically, required for FitImage signing key)
3. Compiles `Image` and `Image.gz`
4. Compiles kernel modules
5. Packages a signed `fitImage` using `mkimage` with the U-Boot signing key and the ITS template from `board-support/prebuilt-images/am62a-evm/`
6. Rebuilds U-Boot A53 (binman) to embed the MO-62A DTB into `tispl.bin`

### 4.4 Stage Build Artifacts

Copy kernel and DTB outputs to `board-support/built-images/`:

```bash
make linux_stage
```

### 4.5 Build Output

After staging, the following files are added to `board-support/built-images/`:

| File | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `Image` | ~18 MB | Uncompressed kernel image |
| `Image.gz` | ~7.0 MB | Compressed kernel image |
| `fitImage` | ~7.3 MB | Signed FIT image (kernel + DTBs), used for verified boot |
| `dtb/ti/*.dtb` / `dtb/ti/*.dtbo` | — | 62 device tree blobs and overlays |

> **Note:** `fitImage` is signed with the `custMpk` key from the U-Boot source tree. The signing step also triggers a rebuild of `tispl.bin` so it embeds the MO-62A DTB (`k3-am62a7-mo-62a.dtb`) in the A53 SPL. This means `make linux` will always update both `fitImage` and `tispl.bin` in `built-images/`.

### 4.6 Build Checklist by Change Type

The flash tool always runs `make modules_install` during both online and offline flashing. This step **unconditionally overwrites** the entire `/lib/modules/<version>/` directory in the rootfs with whatever `.ko` files are currently present in the kernel source tree. If the kernel modules have not been fully compiled beforehand, all previously working modules (DRM/HDMI, Wi-Fi, PWM fan, thermal sensors, etc.) will be wiped from the rootfs, leaving only the modules that happen to exist in the tree at that moment.

Use the table below to determine which build commands are required before running the flash tool:

| Change type | Required build steps |
|-------------|----------------------|
| DTS / pinmux only | `make linux-dtbs` → `make linux-dtbs_stage` → **`make linux`** → `make linux_stage` |
| Kernel source (`.c` / `.h`) | `make linux` → `make linux_stage` |
| U-Boot source | `make u-boot` → `make u-boot_stage` |
| rootfs overlay only (scripts, services) | No kernel rebuild required — flash tool copies the overlay automatically |

> **Important:** Even when only DTS files change, `make linux` must be run (or the kernel module `.ko` files must be confirmed to be fully compiled in the source tree) before flashing. Running only `make linux-dtbs` is not sufficient because it does not compile kernel modules.

The safe, complete build sequence for a new firmware release is:

```bash
# 1. Full kernel build — compiles Image, all modules, and FitImage
make linux

# 2. Stage Image and DTBs to built-images/
make linux_stage
make linux-dtbs_stage

# 3. (Optional) Rebuild U-Boot if U-Boot sources changed
make u-boot
make u-boot_stage

# 4. Flash
sudo bash bin/mo-62a-flash.sh
```

---

## 5. Flashing the SD Card

The unified flash tool `bin/mo-62a-flash.sh` supports two output targets:

- **Online flashing** — write directly to a physical SD card
- **Offline image creation** — create a `.img` file for use with balenaEtcher

Both modes create identical partition layouts and content.

### 5.1 Prerequisites

Required host packages (installed by `setup.sh`):

```
parted  dosfstools  e2fsprogs  pv  xz-utils  zip  wget  curl
```

Ensure the following are ready before running the flash tool:

1. **Built images staged** — run `make u-boot_stage` and `make linux_stage` (or `make all_stage`) so that `board-support/built-images/` contains the required files
2. **Rootfs tarball present** — place a `.tar.xz` or `.tar.gz` rootfs tarball under `filesystem/`
3. **SD card inserted** (online mode only) — the tool automatically detects `/dev/sdX` and `/dev/mmcblkN` block devices

### 5.2 Launch the Flash Tool

The flash tool is interactive and must be run as root:

```bash
sudo bash bin/mo-62a-flash.sh
```

On launch, it prompts you to choose the output target:

```
=== MO-62A Flash Tool ===

Select output target:
  [1] Write directly to an SD card
  [2] Create offline image for balenaEtcher

Select target [1/2]:
```

### 5.3 Online Flashing (Write Directly to SD Card)

Select `[1]` for online mode. The tool will enumerate all detected block devices:

```
Detected candidate block devices:
  [1] /dev/sda  29.7G  SD Card Reader

Select target device number:
```

Then choose the operation mode:

```
Select operation mode:
  [1] full      - create partitions + format + copy BOOT + extract rootfs
  [2] partition - create partitions + format only
  [3] boot      - copy BOOT content only (strict checks, no repartition)
  [4] rootfs    - copy rootfs content only (strict checks, no repartition)

Select mode number (default 1):
```

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `full` | Full write: wipe and repartition, format, copy boot files, extract rootfs, install kernel modules |
| `partition` | Partitioning only: wipe and recreate MBR, format partitions — no content written |
| `boot` | Overwrite BOOT partition only — re-flashes bootloader and kernel without touching rootfs |
| `rootfs` | Overwrite rootfs partition only — re-extracts the rootfs without touching the BOOT partition |

For a fresh SD card, select `full`. The tool will ask for confirmation (`Type YES to continue`), then proceed automatically:

1. Unmounts any existing partitions on the selected device
2. Wipes the old partition table
3. Creates MBR partition table: BOOT (FAT32, 256 MiB) + rootfs (ext4, remaining space)
4. Formats both partitions
5. Copies boot artifacts to the BOOT partition: `tiboot3.bin`, `tispl.bin`, `u-boot.img`, `Image`, DTBs, `extlinux/`
6. Asks which rootfs tarball to use (if multiple are present under `filesystem/`)
7. Extracts the rootfs tarball to the rootfs partition
8. Installs kernel modules (`make modules_install`) into the rootfs
9. Builds and installs any external applications from `board-support/extra-applications/`

Example session (full mode):

```
TARGET DEVICE: /dev/sda (29.7G)

MODE: full
This will ERASE ALL DATA on /dev/sda.

Destructive operation — please confirm.
Type YES to continue: YES

Checking mounts on /dev/sda ...
Wiping old partition table signatures...
Creating MBR partitions (BOOT FAT32(LBA) 256MiB + rootfs ext4 remaining)...
Formatting BOOT: /dev/sda1 (FAT32)
Formatting rootfs: /dev/sda2 (ext4)
Copying boot artifacts to BOOT partition...

Available rootfs tarballs:
  [1] debian-13.2-xfce-v6.12-arm64-2026-01-13-12gb.tar.xz

Select rootfs tarball number (or 'q' to abort): 1

Extracting rootfs to rootfs partition...
Installing kernel modules into rootfs: /tmp/mo-62a-rootfs.xxx/usr/lib/modules
...
Installed: rtk_hciattach

Done. BOOT and rootfs written successfully.
```

After flashing, insert the SD card into the MO-62A board and power on. Boot messages appear on the serial console at `ttyS2` (115200 8N1).

### 5.4 Offline Image Creation (balenaEtcher)

Select `[2]` for image mode. The tool prompts for image parameters:

```
Available rootfs tarballs:
  [1] debian-13.2-xfce-v6.12-arm64-2026-01-13-12gb.tar.xz

Select rootfs tarball number (or 'q' to abort): 1

Output directory (default: bin/out): /path/to/output
Output image base name (default: mo-62a): mo-62a
Image size (GiB, integer) (default: 8): 8
Compression (zip|xz|none) (default: zip): zip
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Output directory | Where to write the `.img` and checksum files |
| Image base name | Filename prefix; output will be `<name>.img` (and `<name>.img.zip` etc.) |
| Image size (GiB) | Total image size. Must be large enough to hold the rootfs; 8 GiB is sufficient for the default rootfs |
| Compression | `zip` (recommended for balenaEtcher), `xz` (smaller file, slower), `none` (no compression) |

The tool creates a sparse `.img` file, partitions and formats it via a loopback device, fills it with the same content as online mode, detaches the loop device, then compresses the result.

Output files:

```
/path/to/output/
├── mo-62a.img         # Raw disk image (8 GiB sparse file)
├── mo-62a.img.zip     # Compressed image for balenaEtcher (if compression=zip)
└── mo-62a.sha256      # SHA-256 checksums of all image files
```

To flash the image with balenaEtcher:

1. Open [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)
2. Click **Flash from file** and select `mo-62a.img.zip` (balenaEtcher accepts compressed images directly)
3. Select the target SD card
4. Click **Flash**

> **Note:** Image size must be at least as large as the expanded rootfs. The default `8` GiB is sufficient for the provided Debian rootfs (~6.9 GiB extracted). When using a custom rootfs, adjust the size accordingly.

### 5.5 Customising the Rootfs Tarball (Adding apt Packages)

The flash tool extracts the rootfs tarball as-is.  Additional Debian packages (e.g. `frei0r-plugins` required by `imx219-preview.sh`) must be pre-installed into the tarball **before** flashing so that they are available both after online and offline flashing without requiring network access on the target.

The standard workflow is:

1. **Install prerequisites on the host** (one-time, x86-64 Ubuntu/Debian):

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y qemu-user-static binfmt-support
   # Registers the arm64 binfmt handler so chroot can run aarch64 binaries directly.
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-binfmt || sudo update-binfmts --enable
   ```

2. **Extract the tarball** into a temporary directory:

   ```bash
   ROOTFS_DIR=/tmp/mo-62a-rootfs
   mkdir -p "$ROOTFS_DIR"
   sudo tar -xpf filesystem/debian-13.2-xfce-v6.12-arm64-2026-01-13-12gb.tar.xz \
       -C "$ROOTFS_DIR"
   ```

   > The `-p` flag preserves file permissions and ownership. Use `sudo` so that device nodes and suid bits are restored correctly.

3. **Copy the qemu binary** into the extracted rootfs:

   ```bash
   sudo cp /usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static "$ROOTFS_DIR/usr/bin/"
   ```

4. **Bind-mount pseudo-filesystems** and enter the chroot:

   ```bash
   sudo mount --bind /proc    "$ROOTFS_DIR/proc"
   sudo mount --bind /sys     "$ROOTFS_DIR/sys"
   sudo mount --bind /dev     "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev"
   sudo mount --bind /dev/pts "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/pts"

   sudo chroot "$ROOTFS_DIR" /bin/bash
   ```

5. **Inside the chroot**, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   # (inside chroot)
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y frei0r-plugins
   apt-get clean          # remove downloaded .deb files to reduce tarball size
   exit
   ```

6. **Clean up** bind mounts and the qemu binary:

   ```bash
   sudo umount "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/pts"
   sudo umount "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev"
   sudo umount "$ROOTFS_DIR/sys"
   sudo umount "$ROOTFS_DIR/proc"
   sudo rm -f  "$ROOTFS_DIR/usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static"
   ```

7. **Repack** the tarball (replace the original file):

   ```bash
   TARBALL=filesystem/debian-13.2-xfce-v6.12-arm64-2026-01-13-12gb.tar.xz
   sudo tar -cpJf "$TARBALL" -C "$ROOTFS_DIR" .
   sudo rm -rf "$ROOTFS_DIR"
   ```

   > Re-packing a ~7 GiB rootfs with `xz` compression takes several minutes.  Use `tar -cpzf` (`.tar.gz`) for a faster but larger archive if turnaround time matters during development.

After repacking, re-run the flash tool as normal. The newly installed packages will be present on the target immediately after flashing, with no network access required.

**Packages currently pre-installed via this workflow:**

| Package | Required by | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `frei0r-plugins` | `imx219-preview.sh` | White-balance correction via `frei0r-filter-white-balance` GStreamer element |

---

## 6. Partition Layout

Both online flashing and offline image creation produce identical partition layouts:

| Partition | Number | Filesystem | Size | Label | Contents |
|-----------|--------|------------|------|-------|----------|
| BOOT | 1 | FAT32 (LBA) | 256 MiB | `BOOT` | Bootloader, kernel image, DTBs, extlinux config |
| rootfs | 2 | ext4 | Remaining | `rootfs` | Root filesystem, kernel modules |

Partition table type: **MBR** (Master Boot Record)

### BOOT Partition Contents

After flashing, the BOOT partition contains:

```
BOOT/
├── tiboot3.bin          # R5 SPL (first-stage bootloader)
├── tispl.bin            # TI SPL (OP-TEE + TF-A + A53 U-Boot)
├── u-boot.img           # A53 U-Boot FIT image
├── Image                # Linux kernel image
├── ti/                  # Device tree blobs directory
│   ├── k3-am62a7-mo-62a.dtb
│   └── ...              # Additional TI DTBs and DTBOs
└── extlinux/
    └── extlinux.conf    # U-Boot extlinux boot configuration
```

### Boot Configuration

U-Boot uses the extlinux boot flow to load the kernel. The default `extlinux/extlinux.conf`:

```
menu title mo-62a MicroSD (extlinux.conf)

timeout 30
default microSD

label microSD
  append console=ttyS2,115200n8 earlycon=ns16550a,mmio32,0x02800000 root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootfstype=ext4 rootwait
  kernel /Image
  fdt    /ti/k3-am62a7-mo-62a.dtb
  # fdtoverlays /overlays/<file>.dtbo
  # initrd /initrd.img
```

The kernel command line sets:
- Serial console: `ttyS2` at 115200 baud
- Root device: `/dev/mmcblk1p2` (partition 2 on the SD/MMC device)
- Root filesystem type: `ext4`

To apply a device tree overlay, uncomment the `fdtoverlays` line and specify the `.dtbo` file path relative to the BOOT partition root.

**Configured boot modes:**

| Priority | Mode | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Primary | SD CARD (MMC1) | 4-bit MMC SD card boot |
| Backup | Ethernet | Network boot fallback |

### 7.16 Hardware Revision Straps

Three hardware revision pins (HW_REV0, HW_REV1, HW_REV2) are routed to the OSPI interface page (sheet 9). These PCB strap resistors (DNF by default) allow encoding the PCB revision and DDR model in hardware for software detection.

---

## 8. Display — DPMS Screen Blanking and Wake

The MO-62A supports automatic display blanking via DPMS (Display Power Management Signaling) and reliable wake-on-input from the blanked state. This required fixes across five layers of the software stack; all are included in the SDK and active after a normal flash.

### How It Works

When the display has been idle for 10 minutes the X server issues a DPMS Off command. SiI9022A cuts the HDMI TMDS link. After a 1-second autosuspend delay the AM62A DISPC hardware is power-cycled by the Linux runtime PM subsystem.

On any keyboard or mouse input:

1. `dpms-wakeup` detects the `/dev/input/event*` activity and calls `xset dpms force on`
2. The X server issues a DRM atomic commit to bring the CRTC back to active
3. The DISPC hardware powers back on; `dispc_runtime_resume()` re-initialises all registers
4. The SiI9022A 20 ms TMDS PLL stabilisation delay runs, then HDMI output is restored
5. `tidss_plane_atomic_update()` re-enables the VID pipeline so pixel data reaches the display

### Fixes Applied

| # | Layer | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|-------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | `drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/sii902x.c` | 20 ms TMDS PLL delay was gated on `mode.clock`, which is 0 after a module reload — PLL never locked, HDMI stayed dark | Delay moved unconditionally before `PWR_DWN` clear; CRTC state fallback added for `mode.clock = 0` |
| 2 | `rootfs-overlay/usr/local/bin/dpms-wakeup` | Xorg does not automatically call `xset dpms force on` when raw input arrives while DPMS is Off | Python daemon watches all `/dev/input/event*` nodes, calls `xset dpms force on` on activity (2 s cooldown) |
| 3 | `rootfs-overlay/etc/udev/rules.d/72-seat-input.rules` | USB input devices not tagged `ID_SEAT=seat0` — logind excludes them because the USB hub parent differs from the DSS/DRM parent | udev rules explicitly set `ID_SEAT=seat0` and `TAG+="seat"` for all recognised input device types |
| 4 | `rootfs-overlay/etc/xdg/autostart/xfce4-power-manager.desktop` | xfce4-power-manager 4.20.0 polls the XSS idle counter and re-blanks the display ~1 s after wake due to a race with the idle-counter reset | `Hidden=true` suppresses xfce4-power-manager autostart; DPMS fully managed by the X server |
| 5 | `drivers/gpu/drm/tidss/tidss_plane.c` | `dispc_initial_config()` resets `DISPC_VID_ATTRIBUTES` bit 0 (VID enable) to 0 on resume; DRM skips `atomic_enable()` because the plane is already bound to the CRTC | `dispc_plane_enable(true)` added inside `tidss_plane_atomic_update()` whenever the plane is visible |

### DPMS Configuration

The X server DPMS settings are applied at XFCE session start by `enable-dpms.desktop` (rootfs overlay: `etc/xdg/autostart/enable-dpms.desktop`):

```bash
xset +dpms              # Enable DPMS
xset dpms 0 0 600       # Off after 600 s idle; Standby/Suspend disabled
xset s off              # Disable the X screensaver
xset s noblank          # Disable X screen blanking
dpms-wakeup &           # Start the input-event wakeup daemon
```

To change the blank timeout, edit the `600` value in the rootfs overlay and reflash.

### Verifying DPMS from an SSH Session

```bash
# Check current DPMS state and timer settings
DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/home/debian/.Xauthority xset q | grep -A3 DPMS

# Blank the display immediately (test)
DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/home/debian/.Xauthority xset dpms force off

# Wake the display (test)
DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/home/debian/.Xauthority xset dpms force on
```

## 9. EEPROM

The MO-62A carries a **BL24C02F** 2 Kbit (256-byte) I2C EEPROM on SOC_I2C1 (address 0x50). It is intended for board identity storage — serial number, hardware revision, MAC address seed, or other persistent metadata.

### Hardware

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| IC | BL24C02F (SOT23-5, compatible with Atmel 24C02) |
| Interface | SOC_I2C1, 7-bit address 0x50 |
| Capacity | 256 bytes, page size 16 bytes |
| Write protect | WP pin (GPIO1_7 / C19 / EEP_WC), active-high, pulled to VCC_3V3_SYS via R267 (10 kΩ) |

The WP pin is driven low by the `at24` kernel driver via the `wp-gpios` DTS property, keeping the EEPROM write-enabled by default. The pinmux pad 0x0194 is configured as `PIN_OUTPUT`.

### Kernel Driver

`CONFIG_EEPROM_AT24=m` is set in `am62ax_mo_62a_defconfig`. The module loads automatically at boot via `udev` device enumeration.

The EEPROM appears as a binary sysfs file:

```
/sys/bus/i2c/devices/1-0050/eeprom   (256 bytes, rw, root only)
```

### Reading and Writing

All operations require root (`sudo`).

```bash
# Read all 256 bytes (hex + ASCII)
hexdump -C /sys/bus/i2c/devices/1-0050/eeprom

# Write a serial number string starting at byte 0
printf "MO-62A-SN001" | sudo dd of=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/1-0050/eeprom \
    bs=1 seek=0 conv=notrunc

# Read back the first 16 bytes to verify
hexdump -C /sys/bus/i2c/devices/1-0050/eeprom | head -1

# Write a single byte (e.g. hardware revision = 0x01) at offset 16
printf "\x01" | sudo dd of=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/1-0050/eeprom \
    bs=1 seek=16 conv=notrunc
```

> **Note:** The BL24C02F has a 16-byte page write buffer. Writes that cross a page boundary are split automatically by the `at24` driver. A 5 ms write cycle time is enforced per page.
